## <a name="aboutme">:information_desk_person: About me</a>
<i>Hello! <br><br>
My name is Gosia. I'm certified Software Tester with over 3 years of commercial experience in testing web apps. In the meantime I have worked on the help desk, as a Buisness Analyst and Project Manager, so I know how the process od Quality Assurance looks from differrent points of view. <br> 
I also have some non-commercial expeience in programming - I know how to make a simple application for choosing a random title from database or to collecting data about your snoring from your mobile phone. I don't see my future in programming, but the ability to understand code has been useful to me many times during testing. <br><br>

Where do I see myself in five years? I'm oriented towards further development as an Automation Tester. </i>
